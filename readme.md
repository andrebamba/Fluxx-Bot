So, this bot was made by a thirteen year old. Many of the process that I found in order to make this bot, was hard work. Much of it was done by:


TrueXPixels, thank you so much for your many tuts! If it weren't for you I would have never learned what an 'args' was. 


EvieCodes, thank you for your straightforward process. I learned much of my codings skills from you.


You can help contribute to this bot! I want this to be a community approach, and this bot to be shaped by the community. I will soon put a link to my GitHub if you'd like to do so. 


Now, I will listen all of the current commands.

Ban = 'ban @'user' "reason"

Kick = 'kick @'user' "reason"

say = 'say "whatever you want it to say"

API Latency = 'apilatency, which calculates it for you.

Embed = It will embed anything for you. Type 'embed "whatever you want"

Talk = It will *cough* troll you.

You can add me on discord : Fluxx#7235

THANKS TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SUPPORTED ME!
